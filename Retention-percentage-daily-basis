##The following SQl queries determine the percentage of user login retention for Day1, Day3 and Day7 of the original app installation date.
##Retention is defined as the action when a user comes back to the platform, where Day 0 is the install date and subsequently, Day 1 is the date after the install date, and so on. 
##For Eg. if the users install the app on 1st July, then Day 1 will be 2nd July, and Day 30 will be 31st July.
